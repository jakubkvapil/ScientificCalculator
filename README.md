# ScientificCalculator
Scientific calculator with natural numeric expression notation, results history and a number system converter.

Created in Java using Swing. Javaluator from fathzer (available at: https://javaluator.sourceforge.net/) is used to calculate the result.

The calculator is now fully functional, but I want to finish a few more things:
* Make minor modifications to CalculatorGUI.java
* Finish the documentation for CalculatorGUI.java
* Translate the documentation into English. 

The calculator has been tested only on macOS. For use on other operating systems it may be necessary to change the font (especially the calculator display font). Monospaced font must be used for proper function!
